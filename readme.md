# Herakles-lib

This is a messy, in-progress migration of shared logic from [herakles](https://github.com/samizdapp/herakles)

More documentation is coming soon, but the TLDR is that this module contains a bespoke proxy server and client code to connect to it from various client runtimes.

The primary support targets are react-native webviews and progressive web apps, but we hope the protocol can evolve to something general purpose.
